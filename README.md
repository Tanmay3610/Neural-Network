**Biological Neuron**

A human brain has billions of neurons. Neurons are interconnected nerve cells in the human brain that are involved in processing and transmitting chemical and electrical signals. Dendrites are branches that receive information from other neurons.

**Artificial Neuron**

An artificial neuron is a mathematical function based on a model of biological neurons, where each neuron takes inputs, weighs them separately, sums them up and passes this sum through a nonlinear function to produce output.

**Perceptron**

A perceptron is a neural network unit (an artificial neuron) that does certain computations to detect features or business intelligence in the input data.
